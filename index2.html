        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I remember back when I was in primary school, I had a boy in my class with ADHD, and he was allowed to do whatever he wanted on the computer when the rest of us followed the lecture. I never saw him play games or mess around, but rather I saw all this wierd writing and colors fill his screen. He tried to explain to me what he was doing, but my 10 year old self was unable to comprehend. It wasn't until years later I learned that that was my first encounter with coding.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was in junior high school in the era of MySpace and Piczo. I had i friend who figured out how to "look behind websites" (which I now know to be "Show page source") and copy/paste to make her MySpace-page look cool. I started experimenting and became kind of good at it even though I did not fully understand what I was actually doing. I even had a dedicaded "HTML-helper" Piczo website that people I knew could copy from to make their own websites look cool.
        </p>
        <p>
            Time went by, and so did MySpace and Piczo. I forgot about coding, and started high school where I studied arts, crafts and design in addition to general subjects. A Nikon D5000 camera, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Sketch Up became my weapons of choice. I graduated and moved to Trondheim to study to become a teacher. At least that was what I thought I wanted to do. But that was before I knew what it was like to lecture in a 5th grade. After my first internship I understood that teaching wasn't in the cards for me. I took a year at college studying arts and crafts just to figure out what I wanted to do next. At the college I attended I came across the study program "digital media production". Here I encountered coding again and I dusted off my old HTML skills, but I never fully understood the CSS thing. I also had classes in programming with Processing and Flash. Unfortunately I did not manage to learn these programming laguages well enough to use them to anything other than (barely) passing the exam.
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduating college and getting my bachelors degree in digital media production, I promised myself never to attend school ever again (and look at me now!). I got a job at a callcenter and then another callcenter, doing customer service. I landed my current job at NAV in 2016 (again, a callcenter, but with better and safer working conditions). In february 2022 I was selected to a temporary 50% position at NAV's IT department to convert all of NAV's old PDF applications into digital forms. Again coding crossed my path, and I had to learn what API's are, and how to hide and show questions in a form using conditionals with JavaScript. This job really sparked my interest in coding again, and made me want to learn more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now you know my education, employment and coding-story, but I obviously have other interests and hobbies as well. In my spare time I love to knit and sing! I've been singing in different choirs since I was 5 years old. I have sung in both Notre Dame and the Kölner Dome and I have even preformed for the Queen of Norway! Right now I sing in a choir that some friends and I started in 2016 called A!Choir (No, the exclamation mark is not a typo). Here's a little thing we made for our audience during the Corona lockdown:

        <h2>My skills</h2>
        <p>
            I had real struggles trying to come up with what my skills actually are. It seems like working with customer service and in public administration for the past 14 years has killed almost all my creative abilities.. At least I'm fricking amazing at customer service I guess!
        </p>
        <p>
            But back when my creative self was thriving, I really enjoyed taking pictures and edit them in Photoshop. So here I present to you a few selected photos ("CSSed" to look like cute polaroids) I snapped back then:
